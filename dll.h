 * @brief Header for our doubly-linked-list circular list library.
 *
 * @warning This library doesn't handle locking. Locking is the library user's
 *          problem. Considering as this was originally written to be used *in*
 *          a thread library, this design decision should make sense; using a
 *          locking queue to implement locks kinda begs the question.
 *
 * @note This linked list design was first hashed out in a largely
 *       410-unrelated conversation about how a really good linked-list library
 *       would look years ago with mbrewer. Credit where it's
 *       due, he gave me some good design ideas. This long after, I don't
 *       remember which are his, and the functions themselves are of course
 *       shaped so that they'll be a good variable-queue implementation.
 *       -zmccord
 *
 * @note The user of this library will declare a list as dll_root_t. Most
 *       operations will be expressed in terms of ops on a dll_root_t, which is
 *       an opaque type representing an abstract linked list.
 *
 * @note Any structure linked into this list will need to
 *       contain a member of type dll_link_t.
 *
 * @note At no point does any function in this library *ever* allocate or
 *       deallocate memory. That's the library user's problem.
 *
 * @note Offsets. Most of the functions in this library take an 'offset'
 *       parameter. This is the offset in bytes from the address of the data
 *       structure where the link field can be found.<br>
 *<br>
 *       An example might make things clearer:<br>
 *<br>
 *       typedef struct {<br>
 *           int value;<br>
 *           dll_link_t link;<br>
 *       } node_t;<br>
 *       node_t a;<br>
 *       dll_root_t list;<br>
 *       dll_init_head(list);<br>
 *       dll_init_link(&a.link);<br>
 *       dll_push_head(&((node_t*)0).link, &a);<br>
 *<br>
 *       Taking offset as void* allows the above addressof trick to be
 *       convenient, and that's the expected common case. If you plan to use
 *       this library much, though, it's probably worth your time to define some
 *       quick convenience functions or macros to save you having to specify the
 *       offset argument all the time.<br>
 *<br>
 *       If you have variable-size objects, you might want to give an offset of
 *       ((void*) 0) and do your addressing math by hand --- although one
 *       alternative is to place the link field at a consistent offset in each
 *       different type or size of object.
 *
 * @note The offset arguments used to be of type void*. This turned out to make
 *       it easy to accidentally write a bug while using the library where the
 *       pointer was of non-char-size type, and pointer math that multiplied by
 *       the referent size surprised the programmer. Now they are ptrdiff_t to
 *       keep us out of trouble.
 *
 * @note I'm sorry the comments are so long. I comment a lot when I'm tired.
